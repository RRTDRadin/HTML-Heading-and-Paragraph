    <H1>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</H1><br><br>

    <p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star, <br>
        How I wonder what you are! <br>
        Up above the world so high, <br>
        Like a diamond in the sky.<br><br>
        
        When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
        When he nothing shines upon,<br>
        Then you show your little light,<br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br><br>
        
        Then the traveler in the dark<br>
        Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
        How could he see where to go,<br>
        If you did not twinkle so?<br><br>
        
        In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
        Often through my curtains peep<br>
        For you never shut your eye,<br>
        Till the sun is in the sky.<br><br>
        
        As your bright and tiny spark<br>
        Lights the traveler in the dark,<br>
        Though I know not what you are,<br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star.<br>
        </p>
        <h1>Expect nothing</h1>
        Expect nothing. Live frugally <br>
On surprise.<br>
Become a stranger<br>
To need of pity<br>
Or, if compassion be freely<br>
Given out<br>
Take only enough.<br>
Stop short of urge to plead<br>
Then purge away the need.<br>
Wish for nothing larger<br>
Than your own small heart<br>
Or greater than a star;<br>
Tame wild disappointment<br>
With caress unmoved and cold.<br>
Make of it a parka<br>
For your soul.<br><br>

Discover the reason why<br>
So tiny human midget<br>
Exists at all<br>
So scared unwise.<br>
But expect nothing. Live frugally<br>
On surprise.
